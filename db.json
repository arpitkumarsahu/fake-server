      "news1": "Unemployment is not new in India. Lack of focus on holistic skill development and job readiness leaves the country’s youth ill-equipped to enter the workforce, making it hard for tech recruiters to find the right talent. The Indian workforce reported the highest skills gap after Brazil. As India grows into a knowledge economy, rapidly adopting technology in the manufacturing and service industries, the emerging gaps at the level of higher education are seen as a major constraint.The 2019-20 Global Skills Gap Industry Report found that 92 percent of employees in India believe that there is a skills gap in the country and 76 percent feel they have been personally impacted by it.",
      "news2": "The rising unemployment in the country is often incorrectly attributed to a shortage of skilled jobs. Though the demand for Indian engineers and analysts is rising worldwide, 63 percent of IT businesses in India report a shortage of skilled talent. Most graduates starting at an entry-level from Tier I institutes, need further training to be job-ready once hired. Students from Tier II and III colleges have a theoretical understanding of some concepts with little or no demonstrable skills. Thus, they need significant further investment in reskilling.With over 1500+ hours of practice-based learning, Masai makes students from varied educational backgrounds job-ready with demonstrable industry skills in software development and data analytics.Speaking on curriculum development, Prateek adds, “Over 50 tech CTOs and industry leaders help Masai develop and update our courses so candidates can start working immediately with the relevant skill sets. This feedback loop keeps our talent fresh and relevant which helps us place Masai graduates at some of the most sought-after engineering teams in India.”"

We have written to our relevant agencies and are awaiting their response.”"

The 1992 policy was prevalent on the date of conviction.In Union of India versus Sriharan @ Murugan, the apex court has said the State should mandatorily seek the opinion of the sentencing court's presiding judge. It has said this opinion would shed light on factors like the nature of the crime that was committed, the record of the convicts, their backgrounds and other relevant factors. These inputs would enable the government to take the ‘right’ decision as to whether or not the sentence should be remitted"

      "news1": "From Rajinikanth to Mahesh Babu, south Indian actors enjoy a certain kind of fandom, which is not often seen or experienced by majority of actors in Hindi film industry. Yes, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and a few others still enjoy a huge fan base, but the craze, which is experienced around stars down south is on another level. Tamannaah Bhatia, who rose to fame with Baahubali and also starred in a couple of Hindi films, spoke about fandom down south. Speaking to Pinkvilla, the actor said the fans have “emotion around the artists.” She added, “For them, it is a very personal and a different connection with them. But I feel, that kind of stardom in the north, it is of course there but I see it is there for those few stars who have consolidated themselves over a period of a decade. That loyalty comes through time.” As the conversation continued, Tamannaah spoke about her career and how she tries to choose the best among what is offered to her. She is thankful to the stars that Baahubali happened, calling it her “best decision.” “I think for me, I always try to choose the best from the work given to me and Baahubali is the best decision out of all. There is no full-fledged way of functioning, but it is an instinct that takes you in the right or wrong directions…I didn’t consciously choose south films over Hindi. I chose project-wise.

      "news2": "From Rajinikanth to Mahesh Babu, south Indian actors enjoy a certain kind of fandom, which is not often seen or experienced by majority of actors in Hindi film industry. Yes, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and a few others still enjoy a huge fan base, but the craze, which is experienced around stars down south is on another level. Tamannaah Bhatia, who rose to fame with Baahubali and also starred in a couple of Hindi films, spoke about fandom down south. Speaking to Pinkvilla, the actor said the fans have “emotion around the artists.” She added, “For them, it is a very personal and a different connection with them. But I feel, that kind of stardom in the north, it is of course there but I see it is there for those few stars who have consolidated themselves over a period of a decade. That loyalty comes through time.” As the conversation continued, Tamannaah spoke about her career and how she tries to choose the best among what is offered to her. She is thankful to the stars that Baahubali happened, calling it her “best decision.” “I think for me, I always try to choose the best from the work given to me and Baahubali is the best decision out of all. There is no full-fledged way of functioning, but it is an instinct that takes you in the right or wrong directions…I didn’t consciously choose south films over Hindi. I chose project-wise. I never looked at any project as south or north Indian,” she concluded. Tamannaah made her debut with 2005 release Chand Sa Roshan Chehra, but she found her first hit with 2007 film Happy Days.

Archana was earlier a part of Comedy Circus. With the show, which ran for 10 years, Archana became known for laughing at the drop of a hat. However, in an interview with ETimes TV, Archana revealed that the production house would use her laughter to boost the contestants and their jokes that didn’t land well. “They would take my laughter reactions on some other jokes and use it for other poor gags or punches,” she said. Archana Puran Singh revealed that she did have an issue with the production house misusing her reactions and had refused to laugh if they continued to keep doing it, which is when they reduced it. However, she admits that the image that Archana laughs at every joke got stuck in people’s mind, which led to memes. But the actor says she does not mind memes. “With me what has happened now is people have started making memes that I laugh a lot. I don’t have any problem with it. I say keep making memes and jokes on me because I am making a lot of money due to all this,” she said. During the conversation, Archana also recalled the “traumatic” events which occurred during her stint on Comedy Circus. The actor recalled that her son had broken his leg during a football match in England. He was brought to India for his treatment but she was shooting.

He turned down the role a handful of times before agreeing, and said in a 2020 interview that it was a phone call from none other than Downey that convinced him to take the plunge. “I knew where they wanted to go, that’s part of the initial deal, not just for Captain America but for Avengers movies and that was daunting,” Evans told The Hollywood Reporter. He said that the phone call from Downey really helped. “Just hearing him kind of give you that little nudge of encouragement, it just made me feel a little bit more like I was part of the gang and not so intimidated. I guess it was a double edged sword, on the one hand it makes you feel very welcome but on the other hand you just think ‘Oh man, I gotta stand next to this guy? He’s crushing this role. I don’t want to be the weak link here.’ But it was a very nice comforting thing to hear that he was in my corner,” he added.",

The Indian workforce reported the highest skills gap after Brazil. As India grows into a knowledge economy, rapidly adopting technology in the manufacturing and service industries, the emerging gaps at the level of higher education are seen as a major constraint.The 2019-20 Global Skills Gap Industry Report found that 92 percent of employees in India believe that there is a skills gap in the country and 76 percent feel they have been personally impacted by it.",

Though the demand for Indian engineers and analysts is rising worldwide, 63 percent of IT businesses in India report a shortage of skilled talent. Most graduates starting at an entry-level from Tier I institutes, need further training to be job-ready once hired. Students from Tier II and III colleges have a theoretical understanding of some concepts with little or no demonstrable skills. Thus, they need significant further investment in reskilling.With over 1500+ hours of practice-based learning, Masai makes students from varied educational backgrounds job-ready with demonstrable industry skills in software development and data analytics.Speaking on curriculum development, Prateek adds, “Over 50 tech CTOs and industry leaders help Masai develop and update our courses so candidates can start working immediately with the relevant skill sets. This feedback loop keeps our talent fresh and relevant which helps us place Masai graduates at some of the most sought-after engineering teams in India.”"

        "news1": "A few days after Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber revealed that he’s suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which has caused partial face paralysis, the artiste recently took to social media once again to update his fans about his health status. The singer stated that while things are getting better every day, he has taken refuge and solace in God. “Wanted to share a little bit of how I have been feeling. Each day has gotten better, and through all of the discomfort, I have found comfort in the one who designed me and knows me. I am reminded he knows all of me. He knows the darkest parts of me that I want no one to know about and he constantly welcomes me into his loving arms. This perspective has given me peace through this horrible storm I am facing. I know this storm will pass, but in the meantime, Jesus is with me,” posted the “Sorry” singer on his Instagram story. In a video shared on his page a few days ago, Justin had spoken about and demonstrated what has happened to him after the nerves in his ear and face were affected due to the said syndrome. While Bieber assured his fans of full recovery, he also made it known that he doesn’t exactly know how long will that process take, as a result of which he’s had to cancel some of his upcoming concerts. “I can’t smile on this side of my face. This nostril will not move. So there’s full paralysis on this side of my face…It will go back to normal. It’s just time, and we don’t know how much time that’s going to be,” Justin had said in the clip.",

        "news1": "Unemployment is not new in India. Lack of focus on holistic skill development and job readiness leaves the country’s youth ill-equipped to enter the workforce, making it hard for tech recruiters to find the right talent. The Indian workforce reported the highest skills gap after Brazil. As India grows into a knowledge economy, rapidly adopting technology in the manufacturing and service industries, the emerging gaps at the level of higher education are seen as a major constraint.The 2019-20 Global Skills Gap Industry Report found that 92 percent of employees in India believe that there is a skills gap in the country and 76 percent feel they have been personally impacted by it.",
        "news2": "The rising unemployment in the country is often incorrectly attributed to a shortage of skilled jobs. Though the demand for Indian engineers and analysts is rising worldwide, 63 percent of IT businesses in India report a shortage of skilled talent. Most graduates starting at an entry-level from Tier I institutes, need further training to be job-ready once hired. Students from Tier II and III colleges have a theoretical understanding of some concepts with little or no demonstrable skills. Thus, they need significant further investment in reskilling.With over 1500+ hours of practice-based learning, Masai makes students from varied educational backgrounds job-ready with demonstrable industry skills in software development and data analytics.Speaking on curriculum development, Prateek adds, “Over 50 tech CTOs and industry leaders help Masai develop and update our courses so candidates can start working immediately with the relevant skill sets. This feedback loop keeps our talent fresh and relevant which helps us place Masai graduates at some of the most sought-after engineering teams in India.”"
